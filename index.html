			<h1>Luis López Trejo</h1>
			<h2>Application — Senior Research Fellow (Policy Research Section)</h2>

			<p>Dear Selection Committee,</p>

			<p>My name is Luis López Trejo, a Political Science graduate from <em>Universidad Carlos III de Madrid</em> and currently completing two Master’s degrees at <em>Universidad Complutense</em>: Big Data, Data Science &amp; Artificial Intelligence and Government &amp; Public Administration.</p>

			<p>I am applying for the position of <strong>Senior Research Fellow (Policy Research Section)</strong> because my academic interests and professional experience converge on the intersection of technology, governance and human rights. My work focuses on how algorithmic systems influence public decision-making, administrative capacity, fairness, and institutional accountability.</p>

			<p>I have conducted research on algorithmic risk, institutional vulnerability, domain shift, and data-driven governance, exploring how public administrations can adopt safeguards and evidence-based approaches to manage the growing impact of AI. This aligns strongly with the Institute’s mission of advancing rigorous policy research with a rights-based perspective.</p>

			<p>Alongside this academic focus, I bring almost a decade of professional experience in strategic communication and analytical work, helping organisations articulate complex issues clearly — a skill relevant for policy briefs, research outputs and collaborative projects.</p>

			<p>I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Institute’s research work and ongoing publications.</p>

			<p>Kind regards,<br>Luis López Trejo</p>
